The function you've written, `function sum() { return a + b }`, has a problem:
the variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope, nor are
they passed as parameters.

If you try to call this function as is, you would get a `ReferenceError` because
JavaScript wouldn't know what `a` and `b` refer to.

To make this function work correctly, you need to pass `a` and `b` as
**parameters** to the function.

Here's the corrected and most common way to write a `sum` function for two
numbers:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

// How to use it:
let result1 = sum(5, 3); // result1 will be 8
let result2 = sum(10, 20); // result2 will be 30

console.log(result1); // Outputs: 8
console.log(result2); // Outputs: 30
console.log(sum(1, 2)); // Outputs: 3
```

---

**Explanation:**

1. **`function sum(a, b)`**: This declares a function named `sum` that accepts
two parameters, which we've named `a` and `b`. These parameters act as local
variables within the `sum` function, and their values will be whatever you pass
in when you call the function.
2. **`return a + b;`**: Inside the function, `a` and `b` now have values, so you
can safely add them and return their sum.

**Alternative: Summing an unknown number of arguments (using rest parameters)**

If you want a `sum` function that can add any number of values you pass to it,
you can use the **rest parameter syntax (`...`)**:

```javascript
function sumAll(...numbers) {
// 'numbers' will be an array of all arguments passed to the function
return numbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue,
0);
}

// How to use it:
console.log(sumAll(1, 2)); // Outputs: 3
console.log(sumAll(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Outputs: 10
console.log(sumAll(5, 10, 15, 20, 25)); // Outputs: 75
console.log(sumAll()); // Outputs: 0 (because the initial value of accumulator
is 0)
```
